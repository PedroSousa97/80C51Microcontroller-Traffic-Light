## Project Scope

This project was developed for the Computer Architecture Discipline of University of Madeira, Computer Engineering Course.

The main goal was to develop two programs, one in C other in Assembly, to run on a 80C51 Microcontroller, that in conjunction with other eletric components simulate an intersection traffic light management system.

The C and Assembly files were created and tested using Keil uVision5 Software, and were later tested on Multisim using the above schematics that I also created.

You can find all the files on this repo.
