## Project Scope

This project was developed for the Computer Architecture Discipline of University of Madeira, Computer Engineering Course.

Two programs, one in C other in Assembly that should have the exact same behavior and outcome, to run on an 80C51 Microcontroller, that in conjunction with other electrical components simulate an intersection traffic light management system. The main goal was to compare the efficiency of both programming languages and compare the resulting Assembly code from the C program.

The C and Assembly files were created and tested using the Keil uVision5 Software, and were later tested on Multisim using the above schematics that I also created.

You can find all the files on this repo.
